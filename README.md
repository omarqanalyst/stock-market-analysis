# Stock Market Analysis & Forecasting

## Overview

This project leverages historical stock market data to showcase various data science and analytics skills, including:

- **Time Series Analysis:** Understanding dynamic stock price behaviors over time.
- **Segmentation:** Grouping stocks and periods based on shared patterns.
- **Visualization:** Creating interactive visualizations for clear communication.
- **Forecasting:** Predicting future stock performance with advanced models.

While individual stocks have nuances, analyzing macro trends serves as an essential baseline for market understanding. Additionally, this project demonstrates strong organizational skills and the ability to handle complex portfolio analyses. My background in analyzing IPEDS data—featuring categorical and completion data—further enhances my approach to stock market analytics and portfolio assessment.
